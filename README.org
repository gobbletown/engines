Specifying an engine in a =.prompt= means that
you don't have to specify the parameters
contained by that engine

Typically, the engine specifies the =model=
and the =lm-command=.

An engine may also load another engine as a
template. This is done by supplying the
=include= key with the title of another
=engine=.
